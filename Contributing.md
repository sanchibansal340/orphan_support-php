  </a>
 
* Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

   where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.


* For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/sanscript-tech/orphan_support-php.git
```

### 3. Create a branch ‚öì

* Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd (filename)
```

* Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

* For example:

```
git checkout -b dev_username
```

### 4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes üöè

* Do the necessary changes.

* If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

* Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhavesh1129/orphan_support-php/main/assets/img/Add.png">
  </a>

```
git add .

## More Contribution Guidelines :guard::page_with_curl:

 1. Issues will be assigned on a first come first serve basis.
 2. Maximum two active issues can be assigned to a single individual.
 3. Mention the essential details, like programmming language you want to work in, while asking for issues.
 4. Make a separate branch for each issue, and use appropriate branch names for the same.
 5. Write clean and easy to understand code. Avoid copy pasting code, we're strictly against plagiarism! 
 6. Provide comments wherever necessary.
 7. Add a README.md to the folders included, explaining the working of the script.
 8. Add an appropriate screenshot of output or demo in the README.
 9. Add a "requirements.txt" file that enlists the program requirements, in case dependencies are required.
10. Perform a self-review before submitting the PR and wait for the mentors to review it and merge.

### :ribbon: **Please go through the following essential steps for successfully submitting a Pull Request here:** :rocket:

1. Star :star: (Optional, will help you stay up-to-date about the later changes in the base repository) and Fork this repository. :checkered_flag:

2. Clone it :globe_with_meridians: using command `git clone <Your_Forked_Repo_URL_Here>` in your CLI. This will download and save a folder for your existing repository, locally in your machine.

3. Switch to a branch using `git checkout -b <branchName>`, in which you are required to work (usually it is 'main' or 'master', but for our cases, it'll be "dev_username". In place of username, mention your GitHub username). Remember, do not directly checkout from 'master' branch of your forked repository.

4. Check existing files, and make your desired updations.

5. Open a command prompt/terminal :man_technologist: in the same directory and enter `git add .` or `git add -A`. This adds all the files for tracking and will be including them in the next commit.

6. Commit your changes :memo: with `git commit -m "<Your One-Liner Commit Message>"`. In place of message, put a valuable and meaningful message so that it is easier for us to understand the changes you have done. This commits your changes locally.

7. Use `git pull -u` or `git pull --set-upstream origin <branchName>` (The `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag only needs to be used in the first time. For later use, `git pull` can be used without any additional flags). This pulls any further changes from the server and ensures that the local branch is again up-to-date with the remote server. 

8. Push your changes :arrow_up: to remote server using `git push` or `git push origin <branchName>`. This pushes your changes to the repository.

After following these steps in Git CLI (in order), you'll need to go to your GitHub repository in the website to initiate a new Pull Request. Now create a pull request by comparing 'dev_username' branch of your forked repository with 'master' branch of this upstream repository. :confetti_ball:

***:trophy: After this, project leaders and mentors will review the changes and will merge your PR if they are found good, otherwise we will suggest the required changes.***

## Style Guides for Git Commit Messages:memo:

#### Here's a list of some good to have points, that can add more value to your contribution logs.

- Use the present tense (example: "Add feature" and not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood (example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called subject line) to 50 characters or less
- Capitalize the subject line
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what, why, vs, and how
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

For more detailed reference to the above points, refer here: [https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/].
